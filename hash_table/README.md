## Exercises
\*Note: HashTable always has a clear (a method is used to clear all nodes), default constructor, arguments constructor and destructor (if the language supports). And key of Bucket in HashTable must be a string.

Create some classes:

- Device has name, company, price.

Questions:
1. Create a generic HashTable to store the data of devices with Open Address Resolution.
2. Create a generic HashTable to store the data of devices with Separate Chaining Resolution.
